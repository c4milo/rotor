//! The module graph: one module per directory of `src/`, wired in dependency order. A module can
//! `@import` only what this file gives it, so the dependency direction is enforced by the build
//! and not by review (CLAUDE.md, Layout).
//!
//! `core` imports nothing. docs/decisions/0001-interface.md names the modules that follow:
//! `uring` and `kqueue` in version one, each importing `core`, and `adapter` after it. `bench/` is
//! outside `src/` and outside this graph; build/bench.zig wires it.
